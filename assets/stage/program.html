<a href="https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~wild/"> Chris Wild</a> is a recently retired Professor of Statistics from the University of Auckland in New Zealand where he taught for 43 years. Currently, his main research interests are in statistics education with particular emphasis on visualisation, software for data analysis and conceptual development, statistical thinking and reasoning processes. Much of his career was spent in developing methods for modelling response-selective data (e.g. case-control studies) and missing data problems, and other aspects of biostatistics. He is probably best known in statistics education for his 1999 ISR paper “Statistical thinking in empirical enquiry” with long-term collaborator Maxine Pfannkuch. He is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association and of the Royal Society of New Zealand. He has been a Council member of the International Statistical Institute (2005-2009), President of the International Association for Statistics Education (IASE, 2003-2005), an Editor of the International Statistical Review, an Associate Editor of Biometrics, the Statistics Education Research Journal (SERJ), and the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics. He was Head of Auckland's Department of Statistics 2003-2007 and co-led the University of Auckland's first-year statistics teaching team to a national teaching award in 2003.
