<h3> Introduction</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://iase-web.org/" target="_blank">International Association for Statistical Education (IASE)</a> is pleased to announce that its 13th Satellite Conference will take place <b>from 11 July to 13 July 2023</b>, just before the 64th World Statistics Congress (<a href="https://www.isi2023.org/conferences/ottawa-2023/">WSC64</a>, 16–20 July in Ottawa, Canada). The conference will be offered in a <b>hybrid format</b> to welcome additional online delegates to those participating in-person in Toronto, Canada. Previous IASE Satellites have brought 80-120 folks from around the world and the host country to share their passion, expertise, and experiences in statistics education. Many delegates also attend the broader World Statistics Congress, which has numerous sessions related to statistics education.</p>
<p>The data landscape is constantly shifting, driven by perpetual technological, economic, and societal developments. Information is now recorded and shared at unprecedented rates, with statisticians called to make sense and use of increasingly complex data. Conventional methods of data analysis are being adapted for this new landscape, while additional approaches are being developed under the umbrella of Data Science. Naturally, these changes have profound implications for education too, raising important questions about what, when, to whom, and how we teach Statistics and Data Science. The broad theme of the IASE 2023 Satellite Conference is <b><i>"Fostering Learning of Statistics and Data Science"</i></b>, which aims to engage with these questions in order to promote and sustain learning in our field.</p>
<p><b>We invite you to participate in this Satellite Conference</b>, to join us in sharing knowledge, questions, and ideas that enable us to learn from the work of  colleagues from around the world and help to advance the teaching and learning of statistics and data science. The conference program will be a mixture of plenary talks, papers, and poster sessions, coupled with opportunities for conversation in person and online.</p>
